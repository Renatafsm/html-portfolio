<h3>Am√©lie</h3>

  Unusual in the very best way. Colorful artistic visuals, quirky funny

  good.

<h3>Little Miss Sunshine</h3>
<p>
  "Little Miss Sunshine" shows us a world in which there's a form, a brochure, a
  procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a
  prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every
  human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or
  turned into a self-improvement mantra about "winners and losers."

<h3> Mars Attacks!</h3>
  <p>
    If you have seen a Burton film before, you have an idea of what to expect.
    Great Classic Sci-fi comedy
